# E-learning Portal :

E-Learning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, or program delivered completely online. We define eLearning as courses that are specifically delivered via the internet to somewhere other than the classroom where the professor is teaching. Built using PHP and Azure services including Azure App Service, MySQL, and Bot Service, our platform enhances user engagement with responsive bot experiences.

# Future Enhancements :

E-learning platforms & elearning development companies provide students living in rural areas with educational opportunities. Because anyone can access these e-learning platforms and online learning from any part of the country, students unable to attend schools can opt for them. All you need is a device you can use to learn and an internet connection. Students can access online courses whenever they want because they are usually pre-recorded and uploaded on the institution’s app or website. This access to information allows the learners to choose any time and place without sticking to a rigorous schedule. This flexibility level will be more prevalent in the coming years and will also eliminate the chances of disturbance from peers and increase focused learning. Students can use the time saved by learning whenever required and planning their day accordingly.
